My Question:
How can I use Hexnode to identify which Windows PCs on version 10 can or cannot be upgraded to Windows 11?

Hexnode support Answer:
To identify Windows PCs on version 10 that cannot be upgraded to Windows 11 using Hexnode,
navigate to the device management section, utilize the "Patches & Updates" feature to scan for updates on each device,
and filter the results to show only devices with a Windows 10 version that doesn't meet the minimum requirements for Windows 11 upgrade;
you can further analyze details like the specific Windows 10 version and potential reasons for incompatibility
based on the updated information provided by Hexnode.
